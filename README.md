Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Using Genetic Algorithm
ðŸš› Optimize Logistics with Advanced Algorithms

Overview
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a complex optimization challenge focused on designing optimal routes for vehicles to visit a series of locations while minimizing overall travel costs. This project leverages a Genetic Algorithm to solve the VRP efficiently.

The solution simulates multiple vehicles starting from a central depot, visiting assigned locations, and returning to the depot. This approach is designed to reduce travel distance and balance the workload between vehicles, making it ideal for logistics, transportation, and supply chain management.

Features
Algorithm: Utilizes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimization.
Scalability: Can handle multiple vehicles and locations with ease.
Visualizations: Interactive graphs generated using matplotlib to visualize the optimized routes.
Randomized Scenarios: Supports dynamic location generation for testing with diverse datasets.
Custom Parameters: Configurable number of vehicles, locations, and genetic algorithm settings.

Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language for implementation.
DEAP Library: A robust framework for evolutionary algorithms.
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For visualizing the results and route optimizations.

How It Works
Input:
Randomly generated or user-defined locations as (x, y) coordinates.
Central depot location.
Number of vehicles and locations.
Genetic Algorithm:
Population initialized with random routes.
Fitness function evaluates total travel distance.
Genetic operations (selection, crossover, mutation) improve solutions iteratively.
Output:
Optimized routes for all vehicles.
Visualized route maps.

Example Output
Visualization of Optimized Routes:
A sample output showing the routes for 3 vehicles visiting 20 locations:
